Development of feature selection based on Mutual Information estimator based on the Renyi quadratic entropy and the Cauchy Schwartz divergence combined with the Parzen window density estimator for continuous variable (see MIDoc.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the method).

Below is an example of the MI/correlation scores of x and y for various distributions of (x,y) pairs:
